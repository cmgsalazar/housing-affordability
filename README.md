# Housing affordability

This repository contains [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) datasets on housing affordability in the U.S., as of March 2025. Specifically:

* **New Homeowner Affordability**: A measure of the share of income the median household would spend on a newly purchased home, including its mortgage payment, homeownerâ€™s insurance, property taxes, and maintenance costs. Typically, spending more than 30% of income on housing is considered unaffordable.

* **New Homeowner Income Needed**: An estimate of the annual household income required to spend less than 30% of monthly income on the total monthly payment after newly purchasing the typical home with a 20% down payment.

* **New Renter Income Needed**: An estimate of the household income required to spend less than 30% of monthly income to newly lease the typical rental.

* **Years to Save**: A measure of the number of years it would take the median household to save for a 20% down payment on a home, assuming they are able to save 10% of their income into a simple savings account accruing no interest. This is equivalent to the number of years it would take the median household to save for a 10% down payment, assuming a 5% savings rate.

Analysis of the data will be used for a story assignment for the *Covering the Economy* (Spring 2025) class at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
